              <h2 class="card-title">Research</h2>
              <p class="card-text">Today we started research on the different genres of games. We knew which type of games we personally liked to play and knew that we wanted to make a game similar to the type we like to play, so we knew we wanted something from the action/fantasy genre. Calvin and Mark both researched the level designes and the type of charachters they would want. This is important because whatever type end getting chose we have to know how to code their traits etc. While Mark and Calvin did this Dylan was busy researching their competitiors and what different game websites looked like. This would give him a feel of what he will be doing and what they generally look like. </p>

              <p class="card-text">Today development of both the game and website commenced. Sketches have been started and soon we will have some solid concept art to work with. The design of the website is currently being worked on by Dylan. This is important in order to portray our message for the game and to match the tone of the game so that it can compliment the game on the website as much as possible. </p>

              <p class="card-text"> This week Calvin was working on creating some of the charachters and creating test animations for them. He created the knight charachter as well using spriter to create an animation for him. While Calvin was doing this Mark was busy finishing the charachter collision in Unity. Meanwhile Dylan was working away on the mood board for the website and making the interaction design of it on mockflow.com. These are important parts of the design of the website.

              <p class="card-text"> Mark has been working on the controller support to see if we can use it for the game although after he did do it it doesn't seem likely we will use it because the it's easier to use a keyboard when playing online. Calvin was working on the level design and finished the charachter design of our other charachter the Warlock. Dylan finished the research documents for the website this week. <br><img src="images/Warlock-bigger-palette.jpg"> </p><iframe src="images/Level design.mp4"></iframe>

              <p class="card-text"> This week Dylan is working on creating a rough layout for the website mainly working on the about section and blog page (this one). Calvin was working on the menus for the game this week as well as animating the second charachter the warlock. Mark brought the level design of the game in to Unity and started creating it. </p>

              <p class="card-text"> After Dylan started created the website layout, he had problems with the nav bar and trying to get it working so he fixed it and got it working. He also worked out some of the bugs with the website. Mark has been bringing in the assets made by Calvin to unity and putting them together with the level design in unity. Calvin finished all the animations getting them ready for Mark to use in the actually game.</p>

              <p class="card-text"> Dylan started adding content to the blog page ie making these blogs every week and putting them online. Mark has been working with the charachters to work out the mechanics of them in Unity and to make sure they do what they're suppose to do. Meanwhile Calvin was working on making the logo for the game the game to go on the pre-loading screen. </p>

              <p class="card-text"> The team are nearly finished with all aspects of the game. Dylan has had to scrap the about page and put the about section on to the home page as it was too bare. So he replaced it with a gallery page showcasing Calvins work. Mark finished making a tournament mode between four players, made the menus and fixed all the bugs. Calvin finished creating the menus in Photoshop and exported them. </p>
